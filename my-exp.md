# My Experience with GDG WOW Pune

## First Encounter

When I first heard about GDG WOW (Women of Wearables) Pune through a friend's social media post, I was immediately intrigued. As someone passionate about both technology and creating inclusive spaces, I knew I had to attend their next event. That was in October 2024, and looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've made for my personal and professional growth.

## The Welcome

From the moment I walked into my first GDG WOW meetup, I was struck by the warm and welcoming atmosphere. Unlike other tech events I'd attended in the past, there was no sense of intimidation or exclusivity. Organizers greeted newcomers personally, and experienced members went out of their way to include everyone in discussions.

## Learning Journey

### Workshops That Made a Difference

The Arduino wearables workshop I attended in November 2024 completely changed my perspective on what I could build. Before that workshop, I had only basic programming experience and had never worked with hardware. By the end of the four-hour session, I had created a simple LED bracelet that responded to movement.

The workshop leaders were patient and thorough, ensuring no one was left behind regardless of their starting skill level. The materials were provided for free, removing what would have been a significant barrier for me at that time.

### Mentorship Opportunities

What truly sets GDG WOW Pune apart is their mentorship program. I was paired with Anjali, a senior developer at a wearable health tech company. Our monthly meetings have provided invaluable guidance as I navigate my early career. Anjali has not only helped me improve my technical skills but has also offered advice on negotiating job offers and overcoming imposter syndrome.

## Community Projects

Being part of the "Wearables for Good" community project team has been an incredible experience. Our team is developing a low-cost health monitoring wristband designed for rural healthcare workers. Collaborating with diverse team members—from UX designers to hardware engineers—has broadened my understanding of product development and reinforced the importance of multidisciplinary approaches.

## Professional Growth

Since joining GDG WOW Pune:
- I've expanded my network with over 50 professionals in the wearable technology space
- Gained hands-on experience with technologies I wouldn't have accessed otherwise
- Delivered my first technical talk on "Accessible Design in Wearables"
- Secured an internship through a connection made at a GDG WOW networking session

## Personal Impact

Beyond the technical skills and professional opportunities, being part of this community has built my confidence. Seeing other women succeed in tech has provided me with role models and concrete examples of possible career paths. The emphasis on supporting each other rather than competing has created a space where I feel comfortable asking questions and taking risks.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my journey with GDG WOW Pune, I'm excited to take on more leadership responsibilities within the community. I've recently volunteered to help organize our upcoming hackathon, and I'm developing a workshop to introduce high school girls to wearable technology.

## Advice for Newcomers

If you're considering joining GDG WOW Pune, my advice is simple: don't wait. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just curious about technology, there's a place for you here. Come with an open mind, be ready to learn, and don't be afraid to ask questions.

The community's strength lies in its diversity—of experience levels, backgrounds, and perspectives. Your unique viewpoint is valuable and welcome.
