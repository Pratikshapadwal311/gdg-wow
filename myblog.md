As part of the global Google Developer Groups network, our chapter focuses specifically on empowering women in the emerging field of wearable technology. This blog serves as a platform to share our journey, insights, and the incredible innovations happening in our community.

## Our Mission

At GDG WOW Pune, we believe in creating an inclusive environment where women can learn, collaborate, and innovate in the wearable technology space. Our mission is threefold:

3. **Innovate**: Foster a collaborative environment where new ideas and solutions in wearable tech can flourish.

## Recent Events

### Wearable Tech Workshop - March 2025
Our recent workshop on integrating Google's TensorFlow Lite with wearable devices was a huge success! Over 50 participants learned how to implement machine learning models on resource-constrained wearable devices. Special thanks to our speakers who demonstrated practical applications ranging from health monitoring to gesture recognition.

### Women in Tech Panel Discussion - February 2025
We hosted an inspiring panel discussion featuring women leaders in wearable technology from various organizations. The conversation covered career paths, overcoming challenges, and future trends in the industry. The Q&A session that followed was particularly engaging, with many attendees receiving personalized career advice.
